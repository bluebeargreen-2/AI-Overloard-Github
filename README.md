The sorce code has been moved to the [Vexico Org.](https://github.com/vexico)

# AI-Overloard
This is my Multiuse TouchScript bot that is using the SpookVoopAPI 


# Prerequisites:
- Code editor (I highly recomend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by microsoft and the install guide is based on this editor)
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) Version 5.2.1 (This is the backbone of the entire bot)

# Steps
1. Download the bot via the command git in a terminal (EX: git clone https://github.com/bluebeargreen-2/AI-Overloard.git)

2. Open Visual Studio Code

3. Click file, then click open folder and navagate to the programs folder

4. on your keyboard do the hotkey "Ctrl + `"
, This will open a therminal, Dont be scared! I will walk you through this

5. type the command "**npm install**" You might get some errors but this is fine

6. Go to the folder src, then click on Config.ts and follow the steps there

7. Copy and Past this command: "**tsc**"

8. To run the bot now you will run this command: "**node dist\bot.js**"
